## 🚧 Under Construction 🚧

This app is still in development and will be uploaded **soon**. The app uses an API, and all that needs to be private before I can fully share the project. 🤔 We all know how important cyber security is.

> **Note:** API secrets need to be hidden away always, but the app is coming along nicely! If you're wondering how I handled the API keys securely, here are a few tips:
> - Use `.env` files for local development.
> - Utilize **GitHub Secrets** or **Environment Variables** when deploying.
> - Keep sensitive information out of version control! 🔐
